We call it Not My Job. People who visit Orlando are excited about the theme parks like Dinosaur World and Gatorland.(CHEERING)SAGAL: But the people who live here are most excited about their basketball team, their Orlando Magic, and its star small forward...(APPLAUSE)SAGAL: ...Aaron Gordon. Aaron joins us now.Aaron Gordon, welcome to WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.AARON GORDON: Oh, thank you. I appreciate you having me on.SAGAL: It's great to have you.GORDON: All right. All right. All right.SAGAL: You've got fans. I've got to ask you - I should admit I'm not, you know, conversant with, like, the basketball stuff - how is it that someone the size of the Statue of Liberty...(LAUGHTER)SAGAL: ...Is a small forward?(LAUGHTER)GORDON: I would like to think of myself as a powerful small forward...SAGAL: Right.GORDON: ...You know? It's just, like, kind of a mix of a couple of different things.SAGAL: Is it, like, a power forward, and then there's a small forward?GORDON: Yeah, exactly.SAGAL: Yeah.GORDON: So it's kind of like a lot of - maybe a hyphen in it.SAGAL: Hyphen? Yeah, OK. Yeah.(LAUGHTER)MO ROCCA: Is the power forward more of a ball hog? Because it sounds like the small forward is nicer and shares the ball more.(LAUGHTER)SAGAL: Yeah.GORDON: When it comes to rebounding, yes. A power forward can just be as ball hog-ish (ph) as he'd like to be.(LAUGHTER)SAGAL: Now, we found out something interesting. You did a lot of sports growing up, as we might expect from a guy of your talents, but you also played hockey.GORDON: Yes.(CHEERING)GORDON: Yes - ice hockey.SAGAL: So what ultimately made you choose basketball over hockey?GORDON: I just kind of had a natural affinity for basketball.SAGAL: Your whole family...GORDON: Yeah.SAGAL: ...Is a family of basketball players. Your parents play? Your father play?GORDON: Yeah. Dad played at San Diego State.SAGAL: Yeah.GORDON: And...SAGAL: And your brother plays pro ball.GORDON: He played pro ball overseas. He's been to a bunch of places. So he plays, and then my sister played at Harvard...SAGAL: Right.GORDON: So she was a Harvard basketball player. And I was.(APPLAUSE)SAGAL: Right. So I imagine your friendly games at home are absolutely vicious.GORDON: Oh, my gosh. Oh, they were...(LAUGHTER)GORDON: ...Gruesome at times.SAGAL: Really? You guys - because I know that one of the things the NBA is known for is trash talk. Do you trash-talk your siblings?GORDON: Oh, definitely.SAGAL: All right. Tell me something.(LAUGHTER)SAGAL: All right. Let's go with what you say to your sister.(LAUGHTER)GORDON: It's kind of like the saying - I'm the youngest...SAGAL: Right.GORDON: So, just by nature, I'm the most annoying.SAGAL: Right. Of course.(LAUGHTER)SAGAL: That's your role. I have a younger brother. Yeah.GORDON: More like, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah, I'm better. You're not. You know what...SAGAL: Yeah.GORDON: ...I mean? Along the lines of...SAGAL: Yeah.GORDON: Yeah.SAGAL: Yeah. I mean...GORDON: That's about it.SAGAL: I mean, just do you, like, leave your NBA contract out on a table?(LAUGHTER)SAGAL: Oh, I'm sorry. I left this here. Let me pick it up.(LAUGHTER)SAGAL: Oh, some money fell out of my pocket. Let me grab that, as well.(LAUGHTER)SAGAL: So here you are in Orlando. You're playing ball. What kind of town is it for playing basketball?GORDON: It's a great city. It's...(CHEERING)GORDON: ...You guys are awesome.SAGAL: I've always wondered about this because everybody knows that sports fans get very passionate. Do you guys care as much as, like, we do about whether you win or lose?GORDON: Oh, man. That's a great question. You know...(LAUGHTER)GORDON: It's - they're really fanatics, you know what I mean...SAGAL: Yeah, I know.GORDON: ...In every sense of the word, you know?SAGAL: Yeah.GORDON: They're - I think they care about it equally if not more than we do.SAGAL: Really?GORDON: Yeah. Yeah.SAGAL: Do you ever feel like looking over at the fans and going, guys, it's a game. Nobody died.(LAUGHTER)SAGAL: We're all actually friends.GORDON: Yeah. They, like, look me in my eyes and say, I hate you.(LAUGHTER)SAGAL: Really?GORDON: Whoa. I don't think I did anything to deserve that, but, you know...(LAUGHTER)GORDON: I'm just going to cordially beat your team, but...SAGAL: OK. All right.(LAUGHTER)SAGAL: I actually - one of the - this - I guess hockey, the fans are closer because they're on the other side of the glass, but there's glass. You guys are, like, closest to the fans of any professional sport. You actually sometimes fall on top of them.GORDON: Yes.SAGAL: And is that weird? I mean, because if you're - like, has one guy in - like, sitting down front like a Jack Nicholson type ever, like, said something to you, like, right in your face?GORDON: Oh, no. See, I think they understand that there's no barrier.SAGAL: Right.GORDON: You know what I mean? So in hockey, there's that glass barrier.SAGAL: Yeah.GORDON: You know, it's kind of like having two dogs on opposite sides of the gate.SAGAL: Yeah.GORDON: You know? Like, they're, like, barking at each other.SAGAL: Yeah. Yeah.GORDON: But then, when you leave the gate, they're, like, oh, OK. Just, you know, sniff each other.(LAUGHTER)GORDON: So there's no barrier, so the fans kind of keep it to themselves because, you know, we have access to them.(LAUGHTER)ROCCA: Have you ever had to console a fan that was upset with your performance?(LAUGHTER)GORDON: Oh, definitely.ROCCA: And how do you do that? How do you approach that?GORDON: Hey, it's OK. I understand. You're very into this game right now.(LAUGHTER)GORDON: But I'm going to continue to do what I do.SAGAL: Right.(LAUGHTER)GORDON: So, like - and they're like...(APPLAUSE)GORDON: OK. You know, OK. They don't really talk after that.SAGAL: Yeah. You are known for your enthusiasm for the slam dunk contest.GORDON: Yes.SAGAL: Yes.GORDON: Yes.SAGAL: And...(APPLAUSE)SAGAL: You did a slam dunk in which you vaulted on top of and then over the mascot. And you just - did you just go up to the mascot and say, you're just going to stand there, and I'm going to jump up, put my hands on your head and go over you, and you're going to hold up the ball. And the mascot was, like, OK.(LAUGHTER)GORDON: Pretty much.SAGAL: The mascot - is he, like - the mascot does not say no to Aaron Gordon.GORDON: It's actually - it's really funny because Stuff the Magic Dragon - he's a great mascot. You know what I mean?(CHEERING)GORDON: He's a great mascot. He is. He's this, like, green dragon. He has these stars on the top of his head. And, when I was practicing, I couldn't get the grip of the ball right. So I was, like, Stuff, buddy...(LAUGHTER)GORDON: You might need to take the stars off your head. And he was really going to take one for the team. He was a team player. And we did it, and I got the dunk. But I could just see the sadness in this mascot...(LAUGHTER)GORDON: ...In his body language - like he had lost a part of himself with the stars. You know, so...SAGAL: Stuff...GORDON: Yeah. So we were, like, OK. We put the stars back on his head. Just - I had to make it work for the sake of him.(LAUGHTER)SAGAL: That's a heartwarming story.GORDON: Yeah.(APPLAUSE)GORDON: That's my good friend these days.SAGAL: Well, Aaron Gordon, we've invited you here to play a game we're calling...BILL KURTIS: Abracadabra.SAGAL: You play for the Orlando Magic, but what do you know about the real magic - by which we mean magic shows?(CHEERING)SAGAL: We're going to ask you three questions about great magicians. Answer two of them correctly, and you will win our prize for one of our listeners - the voice of their choice on their voicemail. Bill, who is Aaron playing for?SAGAL: Hal Ray of Tampa, Fla.(CHEERING)GORDON: OK - Florida boy. All right. Here we go.SAGAL: All right. Here's your first question. One of the great magicians of the late 19th century was Harry Kellar. How did Kellar learn to do his greatest trick, the levitating woman? Was it, A, he was a practicing Buddhist who attained enlightenment and was given control over gravity...(LAUGHTER)SAGAL: ...B, he tied the woman to a thousand trained fleas, who flew her upward...(LAUGHTER)SAGAL: ...Or C, he walked up on stage while another magician was doing the trick, ran around back to see what was done and then ran away.GORDON: I'm going to go with the latter one.SAGAL: You're correct.(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)GORDON: All right. I like that. I like that.(APPLAUSE)SAGAL: It was pretty daring, but that's how you get to be a legend of magic. All right. Second question - let's see if you do as well. Another great magician of that golden era of magic was Carter the Great, and one of his famous tricks was which of these? A, the magical divorce, a trick in which he made his own wife disappear...(LAUGHTER)SAGAL: ...B, the disappearing theater in which the entire audience found itself in a suddenly vacant lot sitting on their butts; or C, the vaguely disquieting meal in which Carter ate an ear of corn raw.(LAUGHTER)GORDON: I think I'm going to go with B.SAGAL: You're going with B - the disappearing theater. All of a sudden, everybody was out there sitting on their butts in a field.GORDON: That's the one.SAGAL: That's the one. He picked it. Sadly, he missed this shot. No, I'm afraid.GORDON: Oh, dang.SAGAL: It was actually the magical divorce. He made his wife disappear. His wife eventually decided that wasn't funny.(LAUGHTER)GORDON: So she's still around.SAGAL: She's still around. She stayed married to him...GORDON: OK.SAGAL: But he changed the name of the trick to the phantom bride. So this is your last question. If you get this right, you win.GORDON: OK.SAGAL: Some magicians have been able to use their skills in real life such as in which of these? A, Doug Henning, who used to skip out on dinner checks by making himself disappear during dessert...(LAUGHTER)SAGAL: ...B, Penn Jillette, who for three years has made himself look like he's lost a hundred pounds by constantly surrounding himself with trick mirrors...(LAUGHTER)SAGAL: ...Or C, David Copperfield, who once made his wallet disappear while he was being mugged.GORDON: I'm going to go with Copperfield. It's C.SAGAL: You're going to go David Copperfield. That's right, Aaron.(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)GORDON: Yay.(APPLAUSE)GORDON: Thanks.SAGAL: He says he was being mugged outside walking to his car after a performance. Some guy came up, tried to mug him, and he made his watch, wallet and passport disappear.(LAUGHTER)GORDON: Oh, man.SAGAL: Bill, how did Aaron do on our quiz?KURTIS: Two out of three is a win.SAGAL: Congratulations.(APPLAUSE)GORDON: Thanks.SAGAL: Aaron Gordon is the small forward for the Orlando Magic. Aaron Gordon, thank you for joining us on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME. Aaron Gordon, everybody.GORDON: All right.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MAGIC\")B.O.B.: (Singing) I've got the magic in me. Every time I touch that track, it turns into gold. Everybody knows I've got the magic in me.SAGAL: In just a minute, Bill sits on his phone in the Listener Limerick Challenge.

Title IX had given her and other young women athletes more opportunities. Still, because she was a girl, Whaley was barred from competing in the team's tournaments.\"That just was a sign of the times \u2014 it just is how it was,\" she says. \"And then fast-forward ... and I am allowed to play in a PGA Tour event.\"Whaley became the first woman in 58 years to qualify for a PGA tournament when she made the 2003 Greater Hartford Open. The athlete broke her latest barrier this past weekend when she was elected president of PGA of America, the first woman to hold the position in the association's 102-year history. Just 40 years ago, women couldn't even be members.\"Obviously the historic nature of it doesn't go past me,\" she says. \"I'm so honored and grateful to have that chance, and to have the trust of my 29,000 members and peers.\"For Whaley \u2014 who also serves as the PGA director of instruction at the Country Club at Mirasol in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. \u2014 being elected was never about being a trailblazer: \"It's always been about wanting to play the game.\"That said, it doesn't hurt being an inspiration to women who want to play a sport known for its exclusivity.\"We still need more women playing the game, and to feel welcome at playing the game,\" she says. \"If young women can see themselves in the business because they see me in the role \u2014 as I saw other women before me who opened the doors for me \u2014 then in that sense I'm thrilled to be a woman in the job.\"In an interview with NPR's Ailsa Chang, Whaley expands on the challenges she has faced, and on her visions for the future of professional golf.It is a large disparity. And, you know, the LPGA Tour has become global for many reasons. You know, we have amazing female golfers from all over the world participating now in the game at the highest level. And oftentimes many of their purses overseas sometimes are even higher than they are domestically [not for the U.S. Open and not for the KPMG women's PGA championship]. A lot of it has to do with television dollars and digital-rights dollars and worldwide sponsors.We need more women and more men to watch ladies' golf. We need them to turn the channel on; we need them to buy into the fact that these are the best athletes in the world. ... What I try to share with the people I teach and coach, and the people that I'm around in the industry, is oftentimes the women's game is much more compatible to that of a really strong club player \u2014 and I don't mean that with disrespect. ...A lot of people can relate to their swing speeds. A lot of people can learn from them by watching them play. They have shots around the greens that they have to have, because oftentimes they aren't hitting short irons in like some of the men are. And oftentimes that's comparable to people who are playing the game at clubs around the country and at daily fee facilities around the country.And once somebody goes to an LPGA event, once somebody goes to the KPMG Women's PGA Championship, they're hooked! They are hooked on women's golf.With scholarship opportunities to our [PGA Golf Management] universities that we have 19 of around the country. And we're making strides \u2014 it's not fast enough, but we're making strides. ... I learned from a male golf professional, and I loved that, but there are many people who prefer to be with somebody that looks like them when they first get started in something new. And if we can have that opportunity for more people we will make greater strides.We have PGA junior league, which is a huge evolving program of 50,000 boys and girls across the country playing PGA junior league golf. They play together \u2014 boys and girls from the same tee. ... We have close to 35 percent girls playing \u2014 we want it to be 50, but we're getting there \u2014 and then we have almost 25 percent of those of color playing.", "title": "Suzy Whaley, PGA's First Female President, On Bringing Inclusivity To Golf", "author": "Emma Bowman", "date": "November 14, 20184:24 PM ET"},

{"url": "https://www.npr.org/2018/11/05/664232524/no-athletes-will-not-shut-up-and-dribble-and-they-never-have", "body": "\n                Oscar Robertson is one of the athletes who's interviewed in the new documentary series .\n                \n                \n                \n            Oscar Robertson is one of the athletes who's interviewed in the new documentary series .The new documentary series , which premiered the first of its three parts this weekend on Showtime, is a response to commentator Laura Ingraham's dismissive February 2018 , one of the series' executive producers. Don't take my word for it that it's a direct response: watch the opening sequence in which Ingraham, disgusted by James and other black athletes speaking out against President Donald Trump, says that nobody elected them, nobody wants to hear from them, and they should, yes, just \"shut up and dribble.\" The idea that athletes \u2014 or actors, or writers \u2014 shouldn't be politically active in the public sphere is surprisingly widely held. The point of the series is to demonstrate that in the case of black athletes, holding the game at a distance from the society in which it's played is not only contrary to history but impossible. And, perhaps, that it would be irresponsible.Narrated by writer Jemele Hill and directed by Gotham Chopra, uses its first installment to chronicle several of professional basketball's early standouts who collided with the wider world in different ways: Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Oscar Robertson, and Isaiah Thomas. It follows the NBA through a period in the 1970s when some worried that the increasing number of black players was alienating white audiences \u2014 a crisis the end of which it credits to the hugely popular rivalry between Magic Johnson and Larry Bird. To that picture, adds the story of the Detroit Pistons and of Thomas, whose comments on how racism influenced the perception of Bird became very controversial, to the point where the broader observation he was making \u2014 about who is considered simply a \"natural talent\" and who is considered a \"smart player\" \u2014 was lost. People who have watched a lot of NBA documentaries, or who have watched projects like that try to look at the intersection of sports and the world at large, will know a good number of these stories, maybe including the stories of Russell and Robertson, and how Bird was called \"the great white hope\" whether he wanted to be or not, and how his rivalry with Johnson had \u2014 as one commentator wildly understates it \u2014 a \"tinge\" of racial dynamics in it. But there are good segments in the first installment that might be less familiar about the way the ABA and the NBA presented basketball very differently, the way labor issues among players were (and are) inextricably linked to race, and the way Abdul-Jabbar \u2014 now a columnist, a comic book writer, and a writer on the upcoming revival of  \u2014 decided to decline to try out for the 1968 Olympics. The next two installments follow the NBA through later phases, up to the present. They consider the era of Michael Jordan and the explosion of endorsement deals \u2014 which, the film's interviewees suggest, tamped down public discussions of politics as protection of each athlete's personal brand became critical. They examine the career of Allen Iverson, whose path to the NBA \u2014 and his clothes and hair and tattoos and connections to hip-hop \u2014 made him a beloved figure to a lot of fans who perhaps didn't relate to Michael Jordan or Magic Johnson. Critically, the series at one point turns its attention to the 2004 Pacers-Pistons fight \u2014 the one that spilled into the stands \u2014 that led to long suspensions, including for Metta World Peace (who then went by Ron Artest). It's a necessary chapter in part because it's impossible to consider the public activism, and the significance of public activism, of black athletes without recalling how easily after this incident commentators slipped into calling players \"thugs,\" and how that fight seemed to surface ugly attitudes about players that had been simmering in sports media and in the NBA itself. Again, players have never had the option of shutting up and dribbling; they, like everyone, live and work in a particular social context. And it's a context in which racism affects the way they're talked about, the way they're treated, and the way their behavior is received.And yes, we eventually reach the Obama years, and then the 2016 election. We reach Trayvon Martin and Eric Garner, and we learn that LeBron James' decision to go to the Miami Heat \u2014 not the ill-advised TV special, but the choice itself \u2014 may have affected the power balance between players and owners in a way that's made activism for players safer. That, of course, goes back to Oscar Robertson's fight for free agency chronicled in the first episode, too.This is what good documentaries do: they provide an overview, but they also make interesting connections between specific pieces of the story. While it's about activism and racism, much of this series is about power. Power accumulated by players, whether it's the economic power of endorsements or the bargaining power of free agency, directly enables them to use their platforms without worrying that they'll be, for instance, let go from their teams and unable to get new jobs because a political stand they consider crucial proves to be unpopular, or makes them targets. An unspoken thesis of the series is that the concept of athletes not belonging in politics is about discomfort with, and resentment of, that considerable power. It's a strange idea, this expectation that players must entertain and not speak. The NBA is a business that makes ridiculous money for mostly white owners from the work of many black athletes. It's fed by the NCAA, which makes ridiculous money for schools from the work of many black athletes.

Ballybrack's opponents that Saturday agreed to call off their scheduled game out of respect for LaFuente, and teams across the  observed somber  before they resumed play.Condolences to everyone involved at Ballybrack FC on the tragic passing of their player making his way home from training on Thursday night. All at Rush Athletic express our deepest sympathies.There was just one minor issue: Fernando LaFuente is very much alive.\"After my work finished I was playing some video games, and suddenly I got a call from work,\" LaFuente  on Wednesday. His coworkers called Tuesday night to check in on him. They'd seen reports about his \"accident.\"\"They started sending me all these news articles and all these mass media,\" he explained. \"And that's how I found out I was dead.\"As it turns out, Ballybrack officials had faked his death.A Spanish national, LaFuente said he had played on the team since January. But he dropped out about two months ago, when he left Ireland's capital for work in Galway, on the other side of the country. It appears at least one team manager used his move as a convenient opportunity to wriggle out of playing Saturday's match.Later asked why he thought the team did it, LaFuente said they were most likely just struggling with a thin bench as the game approached. \"I think maybe they had a rough time getting players,\" he told the Irish broadcaster. \"They don't play professionally. Most of them have regular jobs and some of them work in the UK or at university, people moving to other countries.\"League Chairman David Moran said the story began to come apart Monday, when he inquired about funeral arrangements.
