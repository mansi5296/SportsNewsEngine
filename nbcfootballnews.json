Could he make his return this season, in the Pro Bowl?That\u2019s what some of his supporters plan to find out. This year the NFL is allowing fans to vote for Pro Bowlers on Twitter by using the hashtag #ProBowlVote and writing the name of the player they want to vote for. That means players don\u2019t have to be on any official ballot to receive a Pro Bowl vote. They simply have to have their names tweeted. And Kaepernick has plenty of supporters on Twitter who have begun voting for him.Will the NFL count those votes? It seems doubtful. The league will probably say that only active players can be voted into the Pro Bowl. But there\u2019s precedent in other sports for players who weren\u2019t actually actively playing to appear in an all-star game. Most notably, Magic Johnson, who retired from the NBA before the 1991-92 season, was still voted into the all-star game by the fans, played in it and won the game\u2019s MVP award.And perhaps the league, feeling pressured by Kaepernick\u2019s collusion lawsuit, would decide to extend the invitation to Kaepernick, if he wins the fan vote.

And he will be exposed to waivers.\u00a0And so the next question becomes whether anyone will claim him on waivers.On Tuesday, Washington surprisingly claimed former 49ers linebacker Reuben Foster on waivers. Destined for the Commissioner Exempt list, Washington chose to pay Foster $257,000 over the balance of the season in order to secure dibs on future services in 2019.But for the Foster kerfuffle, there\u2019s a chance one or more teams would have pounced on Hunt. The reaction to the acquisition of Foster could keep all teams from paying Hunt $33,000 per week to not play in order to have the rights to the balance of his rookie contract when he\u2019s cleared to play.Surely, he\u2019ll eventually be cleared to play. While Hunt\u2019s misconduct merits punishment, it doesn\u2019t merit banishment. (Then again, Colin Kaepernick\u2019s conduct, which wasn\u2019t even misconduct, resulted in banishment.) At some point, the league will impose punishment on Hunt, Hunt will serve an unpaid suspension, and Hunt then will be able to play.This isn\u2019t an over-the-hill Ray Rice, whose best football days were behind him. This is a guy who led the league in rushing as a rookie. He\u2019ll get his second chance somewhere, just not in Kansas City.Potential candidates include, as mentioned last night, the Eagles. Also, the Browns currently are run by the guy who drafted Hunt in Kansas City. And what if Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy ends up coaching his own team (which could be Cleveland)?Plus, Washington can never be ruled out, because Washington already has proven that talent continues to trump whether and to what extent a player has gotten in trouble. And Hunt clearly has talent.

And, yes, the Saints are suspicious.The Cowboys have explained the issue in this way: \u201cIt\u2019s a member of the game day entertainment staff.\u00a0 He stands next to the \u2018green hat\u2019 who is the network TV person who works with the officials to coordinate TV timeouts. \u00a0His job is to communicate to our internal video board people when a TV time out is coming and how much time is left in that timeout as they come out of a break.\u00a0 He does not stand in the team bench area.\u00a0 They stand just outside the bench area on that side of the field.\u201dThe image that was tweeted shows the person close to Saints coach Sean Payton, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the person was in the bench area. The Cowboys insist that the employee would never enter the bench area, toward the middle of the sideline.Whether the Cowboys\u2019 explanation satisfies the Saints\u2019 suspicions remains to be seen. If the Cowboys were going to be engaged in any type of spy operation, it definitely would be unusual for the guy to be wearing a polo shirt bearing the Cowboys logo.The NFL has not responded to a request for comment regarding the situation.A similar incident occurred in 2015, when the Jets instigated a sideline interrogation of Kraft Sports employees during a game against the Patriots. Those employees were also responsible for in-stadium entertainment, and one was responsible for providing batteries to the referee\u2019s wireless microphone.The easiest way to avoid these situations would be to require the employees of a given team to do whatever they have to do from the sideline of the team they work for.

{"url": "https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2018/12/01/nfl-may-have-overcorrected-post-ezekiel-elliott/", "body": "The Ray Rice fiasco, which nearly brought sweeping and dramatic change to the league office, sparked the NFL to respond in a way that would avoid future P.R. debacles. And then, in the opinion of at least one influential owner, the NFL went too far the other way, creating problems when there officially otherwise were none.Less than two years after Ray Rice, the NFL launched an aggressive investigation regarding allegations of domestic violence against Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott. The league eventually imposed a six-game suspension on Elliott, even though he was never criminally charged or civilly sued. The procedures, which included a half-dozen private interviews of the alleged victim, included no opportunity for Elliott to confront or question the accuser, and featured at least one league investigator who believed that Elliott should not be suspended.The situation greatly angered Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, and it fueled a persistent, creative, and stunning effort by Jones in 2017 to block the Commissioner\u2019s contract extension, with the ultimate goal of securing a new Commissioner.And so, in the immediate aftermath of the Commissioner getting his extension, it appears that the league may have softened its stern, unforgiving approach to off-field misconduct, an approach that ignored all efforts of law enforcement and drilled down on the facts and circumstances with the goal of reaching a conclusion as to whether the player did what he was accused of doing, under a much lower standard of proof than beyond a reasonable doubt. How else can anyone explain the fact that soon-to-be-former Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt: (1) was accused of shoving a woman in February 2018; (2) nothing seemed to happen over an extended period of time, even though the alleged victim clearly was motivated to receive some sort of justice or satisfaction; and (3) nearly 10 months later, a video of the incident suddenly emerges and Hunt is immediately suspended with pay by the league and then fired without pay by his team?The league says it never saw the video before TMZ published it. Privately, the contention is that multiple attempts were made to obtain the video, that the hotel refused to provide the video to the NFL, and that the Cleveland Police Department likewise didn\u2019t provide the video. (Others are reporting these contentions as facts. They aren\u2019t facts; they are contentions that may or may not ultimately be supported by facts.)Whatever the contentions or private explanations, here\u2019s the reality: If the league learned anything from the Ray Rice case, it learned that it must do anything and everything to track down any and all available video of any alleged incident involving a player, because it always must be assumed that the video eventually will be obtained by TMZ. And if the league opted not to do that in Hunt\u2019s case, the only explanation (other than gross incompetence) is that the NFL has decided to search for a middle ground between Rice and Elliott, one that entails swift and decisive action when required along with a commitment to focusing only on football unless and until the hand of the Shield is forced.If that\u2019s the compromise, it may not be the right one. Because it may not be enough to suddenly say, \u201cOh, there\u2019s video? We tried to get the video but no one would give us the video. Well, now that there\u2019s video, that changes everything.\u201dAs a multi-billion-dollar operation that is far bigger and more powerful than TMZ, it\u2019s fairly presumed that the league has the ability to get anything that TMZ is able to get. And if the NFL doesn\u2019t have the current internal expertise to get videos that TMZ seems to always obtain, maybe the NFL needs to hire someone from TMZ to help the NFL figure out how to get those videos.That\u2019s the biggest flaw in the balance the NFL currently seems to be trying to strike. Given the power of video, the league should always be relentless when it comes to tracking down any and all video of any player incident, since it always should be assumed that the video will inevitably emerge.", "title": "NFL may have overcorrected, post-Ezekiel\u00a0Elliott", "author": "Posted by Mike Florio", "date": "December 1, 2018, 10:36 AM EST"},

Others have said that we shouldn\u2019t worry about winning and that a benefit would be that we would have a better draft position.\u201dIt\u2019s a bit of a surprise that Murphy would proactively address the issue of tanking. Yes, the temptation to tank is real, and from a business standpoint it makes plenty of sense to put lesser players on the field under the guise of evaluating them, but with a broader goal of losing now and winning in April via higher slots in each of the seven rounds of the draft. But the NFL and its teams typically avoid affirmatively discussing (and in turn legitimizing) what amounts to a direct threat to the integrity of late-season games between teams that have something on the line and teams that don\u2019t.\u201cI\u2019m not ready to give up on the season,\u201d Murphy adds, as if he or anyone else would admit to giving in to the tanking temptation. \u201cNow, I realize that we are 4-6-1 (and as Bill Parcells famously said, \u2018You are what your record says you are\u2019) and that we haven\u2019t played well. However, we still have almost a third of the season left to play. I know that the odds of making the playoffs are slim (I\u2019ve seen odds range from 3 to 15 percent), but we still have a lot to play for. If we can finish the season strong, even if we don\u2019t make the playoffs (and crazier things have happened), it will give the team confidence that can carry over to next year. Also, from the individual player\u2019s standpoint, the average career is so short (3.1 years) and every game means so much, they all have much to play for over the next five weeks.\u201dMurphy doesn\u2019t mention that the head coach also has a strong incentive to win as many games as possible, in an effort to save his job.

But no flag was thrown.There\u2019s a good chance the call would have been missed even if the rule hadn\u2019t been unofficially relaxed. Officials are still adjusting to a widening of the focus, watching one player approaching another and adopting the prohibited linear posture before making impact. Last night, Smith rocketed toward Kamara, and the seven officials who are primarily trying to avoid being trampled by young men in armor didn\u2019t see it coming.That\u2019s why the NFL needs to eventually embrace the use of an eighth member of the officiating crew. But that person wouldn\u2019t be put on the field. Official No. 8 would sit at a bank of monitors, seeing every possible camera angle. Official No. 8 would be in constant contact with the referee or some other member of the on-field crew. Official No. 8 would serve as an extra set of eyes from the perspective of a viewer, bridging the gap between what the officials see from within the field and what the rest of us see from within our homes.It wouldn\u2019t be part of the replay process, because it wouldn\u2019t be replay review, per se. It would be an embrace of the primary manner in which pro football is consumed, and it would provide real-time assistance to the officiating crew from place of no physical peril.Eventually, it will happen. A blown call that affects a game and/or the application of the betting line will, as legal wagering spreads, force the league to make what should be an easy and obvious change. As hard-earned dollars legitimately ride on whether or not officials get it right, the league will face relentless pressure to get it right, all the time.For decades, the supposed purity of sport has embraced the impurity of human error. When the final score of sporting events begin to have the same relevance to American society as the rising and falling of stock prices, the challenge for sports leagues will be to take all steps necessary to eradicate human error from its games.Having a real-time video official who has the same standing as an official who is standing on the field would assist in that objective, while creating relatively minimal delays.

{"url": "https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2018/11/29/pfts-week-13-picks-9/", "body": "It\u2019s the first non-bye week since September, with a full slate of 16 games. And MDS and yours truly agree on the outcome of every game.This means that a three-game spread will persist, with four weeks to go. After we each finished 8-4 on Sunday/Monday of Week 12, I\u2019ve got\u00a0a season-to-date record of 112-64 (63.6 percent). MDS is 109-67 (61.9 percent).Also, check out the weekly \u201cbest bets\u201d video. Last Sunday, MDS and I were each 2-1.Saints at CowboysMDS\u2019s take: The Cowboys could make a major statement in the NFC playoff race with a win here, but I just don\u2019t see it happening. The Saints are too good.MDS\u2019s pick: Saints 27, Cowboys 20.Florio\u2019s take: Sean Payton reminds Jerry Jones why Jerry Jones may still eventually try to hire Sean Payton.Florio\u2019s pick: Saints 34, Cowboys 17.Ravens at Falcons MDS\u2019s take: The Falcons\u2019 defense isn\u2019t very good, but I have a feeling the Ravens\u2019 offense is going to fail to exploit it, as Lamar Jackson will struggle. Atlanta takes this one at home.MDS\u2019s pick: Falcons 23, Ravens 16.Florio\u2019s take: Lamar Jackson takes his starting show on the road, and he quickly realizes that the Falcons aren\u2019t the Bengals or the Raiders.Florio\u2019s pick: Falcons 24, Ravens 14.Panthers at Buccaneers MDS\u2019s take: Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston had his best game of the season last week, but Panthers quarterback Cam Newton will outplay him this week.MDS\u2019s pick: Panthers 31, Buccaneers 21.Florio\u2019s take: The Panthers get a good draw as they try to end a three-game losing streak.Florio\u2019s pick: Panthers 41, Buccaneers 30.Bears at Giants MDS\u2019s take: Chase Daniel over Mitchell Trubisky? I\u2019m not sure it will make much difference. The Giants\u2019 offense has been playing well recently, but not against the Bears.MDS\u2019s pick: Bears 20, Giants 10.Florio\u2019s take: It\u2019s a trap game for the Bears, who will be facing a feisty Giants team that doesn\u2019t care about winning its way to lower draft slots.Florio\u2019s pick: Bears 23, Giants 20.Bills at Dolphins MDS\u2019s take: The Bills look like they\u2019re starting to get things going, but the Dolphins should be able to beat them at home.MDS\u2019s pick: Dolphins 20, Bills 17.Florio\u2019s take: Finally, a game the Dolphins should be able to win.Florio\u2019s pick: Dolphins 20, Bills 10.Colts at Jaguars MDS\u2019s take: The Jaguars\u2019 offseason decision to commit to Blake Bortles was unwise, but that doesn\u2019t mean benching him for Cody Kessler will be the answer, especially not against a Colts team that is playing very well right now.MDS\u2019s pick: Colts 24, Jaguars 17.Florio\u2019s take: The Colts possibly are becoming what the Jaguars were supposed to be.Florio\u2019s pick: Colts 27, Jaguars 13.Browns at Texans MDS\u2019s take: The Browns have definitely played better since firing Hue Jackson, but the Texans\u2019 winning streak will keep going.MDS\u2019s pick: Texans 24, Browns 14.Florio\u2019s take: The Browns and Baker Mayfield could make this one interesting, but the Texans are simply too good.Florio\u2019s pick: Texans 30, Browns 23.Broncos at Bengals MDS\u2019s take: It\u2019s a tough spot for new Bengals starting quarterback Jeff Driskel, as the Broncos are getting things turned around and potentially marching toward the playoffs.MDS\u2019s pick: Broncos 28, Bengals 23.Florio\u2019s take: The Broncos are unexpectedly surging, the Bengals are expectedly falling apart.Florio\u2019s pick: Broncos 27, Bengals 17.Rams at Lions MDS\u2019s take: Sean McVay has shown how quickly a good coach can turn around a bad team. Matt Patricia has shown how quickly a bad coach can make things worse.MDS\u2019s pick: Rams 30, Lions 20.Florio\u2019s take: The Rams keep pushing toward the playoffs, and the Lions keep pushing toward the NFC North basement.Florio\u2019s pick: Rams 34, Lions 20.Cardinals at PackersMDS\u2019s take: I don\u2019t think the Packers are going anywhere this season, but they\u2019re at least playing well enough that beating the Cardinals at home shouldn\u2019t be a problem.MDS\u2019s pick: Packers 24, Cardinals 10.Florio\u2019s take: Poor Cardinals.Florio\u2019s pick: Packers 38, Cardinals 13.Chiefs at Raiders MDS\u2019s take: The Chiefs are the best team in the AFC and the Raiders are the worst team in the AFC. Enough said.MDS\u2019s pick: Chiefs 31, Raiders 13.Florio\u2019s take: One of the NFL\u2019s best rivalries won\u2019t be on Sunday.Florio\u2019s pick: Chiefs 37, Raiders 16.Jets at Titans MDS\u2019s take: It\u2019s getting rough for Todd Bowles as he heads into what looks like his last month as the Jets\u2019 head coach. Another loss should just about seal it.MDS\u2019s pick: Titans 28, Jets 14.Florio\u2019s take: The Titans face an uphill climb to get to the playoffs, but they\u2019ll hold serve against an inferior team.Florio\u2019s pick: Titans 27, Jets 17.49ers at Seahawks MDS\u2019s take: The Seahawks are playing hard and appear to be heading toward the playoffs in what easily could have been a rebuilding year. That\u2019s a credit to Pete Carroll.MDS\u2019s pick: Seahawks 34, 49ers 20.Florio\u2019s take: Richard Sherman returns home with a chance to spoil a Seattle playoff run. Unfortunately for Sherman, there aren\u2019t enough players as talented as Sherman around him.Florio\u2019s pick: Seahawks 24, 49ers 13.Vikings at Patriots MDS\u2019s take: One of the best games of the day feels like it could go either way, but I like the Patriots to pull it out late.MDS\u2019s pick: Patriots 24, Vikings 21.Florio\u2019s take: Vikings simply don\u2019t match up well with a Patriots team that matches up well with pretty much everyone. This could get ugly.Florio\u2019s pick: Patriots 31, Vikings 20.Chargers at Steelers MDS\u2019s take: This is a very big one in the AFC playoff race, perhaps a must-win for the Chargers if they have any hope of catching the Chiefs in the AFC West. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen.MDS\u2019s pick: Steelers 21, Chargers 20.Florio\u2019s take: Austin Ekeler will need to step up if the Chargers will have a chance to win this one. Even if he does, the Steelers are still good enough to get their act together after an unexpected loss in Denver.Florio\u2019s pick: Steelers 27, Chargers 23.Washington at EaglesMDS\u2019s take: I was ready to write off the Eagles a couple weeks ago. I\u2019m not anymore. I\u2019m expecting a three-way tie atop the NFC East after Week 13.MDS\u2019s pick: Eagles 20, Washington 17.Florio\u2019s take: Every week it seems there\u2019s another NFC East favorite, with Dallas losing to the Saints, the Eagles can make it a three-day tie for now, setting up for another showdown in Dallas next weekend.Florio\u2019s pick:\u00a0 Eagles 31, Washington 17.", "title": "PFT\u2019s Week 13\u00a0picks", "author": "Posted by Mike Florio", "date": "November 29, 2018, 11:56 AM EST"},

The Saints will have the NFC South crown with a win and a Panthers loss or tie or a tie and a Panthers loss.The Rams had a chance to clinch the NFC West during their bye week, but the Seahawks\u2019 win against the Panthers meant they had to wait. A Rams win, a Seahawks loss or ties in both of their games to win their second straight divisional championship.\u00a0The Rams have several scenarios that involve clinching a playoff berth while tying the Lions, but a win or a Seattle loss remains the most likely way for them to book passage to the postseason before Week 14.The Saints will be in the playoffs with a win. There are other scenarios that get them in if they tie the Cowboys, but none if they should lose in Dallas on Thursday night.Over in the AFC, the Chiefs are the only team in position to clinch a playoff berth. For that to happen they will need to beat the Raiders and get a fair amount of help from other results around the AFC. Those scenarios are listed below:1) MIA loss or tie + IND loss + HOU loss + TEN loss or tie2) MIA loss or tie + IND loss + HOU loss or tie + BAL loss or tie + CIN loss or tie3) MIA loss or tie + IND loss + HOU loss or tie + BAL loss + LAC loss", "title": "Saints, Rams and Chiefs can clinch playoff berths this\u00a0week", "author": "Posted by Josh Alper", "date": "November 28, 2018, 2:22 PM EST"}
