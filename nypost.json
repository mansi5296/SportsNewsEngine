Mets rookie general manager Brodie Van Wagenen has made his first deal a franchise-shaking doozy, one that could go quite the distance in determining whether the Mets\u2019 questionable hire succeeds.If the deal goes through, as widely expected, the Mets will agree to take on the ex-Yankee Cano, 36 and less than a year removed from an 80-game suspension for an illegal performance-enhancing drug offense, and pay him an average of eight figures through his age-40 season. They will give up two of their best prospects in pitcher Justin Dunn and outfielder Jarred Kelenic, as well as Jay Bruce and Anthony Swarzak, both of whom excelled in 2017 before stumbling last year, and relief pitcher Gerson Bautista.They will assume these considerable risks because they\u2019re getting Diaz, the 2018 Mariano Rivera AL Reliever of the Year \u2014 who, by virtue of his youth, will cost a fraction of what his equivalents and inferiors will receive on the open market this winter and who won\u2019t be eligible for free agency until after 2022. If Diaz can even approach the statistical excellence he exhibited last season \u2014 and, no small thing, prove he can handle the scrutiny of closing in New York \u2014 he can mitigate many of this trade\u2019s other concerns.Because, man, was Diaz something else this past season. So much so that even his friends in the AL can\u2019t wait to not see him anymore.The 2018 Mariners exceeded their run differential by 12 wins, and Diaz arguably can take the most credit for that impressive disparity. The 24-year-old registered 57 saves, tying Bobby Thigpen (1990) for the second-highest single-season total in baseball history behind the 62 Francisco Rodriguez tallied for the Angels in 2008. Diaz set his own record with 27 saves recorded upon entering the game with a one-run lead.He blew just four save chances, and in all of those, he allowed the opponent to only tie the game. The Mariners proceeded to win all four of those games, meaning they went 61-0 when they handed Diaz a save opportunity.In 73 \u00b9/\u2083 innings pitched, Diaz struck out 124 and walked 17, a 7.29 ratio that the great Rivera exceeded just twice in 19 years. Only the Dodgers\u2019 Eric Gagne, in both 2002 and 2003, had put up at least 50 saves and 100 Ks in the same season. Is it any wonder Diaz received support for both the AL Cy Young Award (eighth place) and the AL Most Valuable Player honor (18th place)?\u201cHe had everything working for him this year,\u201d said Espada, whose Astros managed a .303 OPS against Diaz in 27 plate appearances over eight games and .756 against everyone else. \u201cHe was really lights out.\u201dThe most encouraging news for Mets fans? Diaz didn\u2019t emerge from oblivion to produce a potential one-hit wonder. Though 2018 established a new peak for him, it marked a continuation of what he already had displayed. Thanks to a lethal fastball-slider combination, he already has 109 career saves on his ledger, attained via an outstanding 156 ERA+ in 188 games totaling 191 innings.\u201cThis is a young kid that came to the big leagues when he only had a month of bullpen experience at the Double-A level,\u201d Stottlemyre said. \u201cJust from where he\u2019s come up and where he is now, the feel for his stuff \u2026 Everybody knew that he had wipeout stuff, but it takes players time to put things together. The first couple years, I saw a lot of spots where young pitchers start to panic and are unsure. This entire year, from spring training on, he had the calmness and the confidence and the ability to slow the game down.\u201dThe key to elevating from, let\u2019s say, a B-plus to an A-plus? In addition to growing mentally from his reps, Diaz grew his fastball. Not its velocity \u2014 it increased slightly from an average of 97.77 mph to 98.01, as per Brooks Baseball \u2014 but rather its quality and efficiency.\u201cWe really studied the Trackman to see where his best stuff played,\u201d Stottlemyre said. \u201cHe would elevate his fastball and get a lot of swings and misses on fastballs in the zone. He threw more strikes and got more confidence.\u201dDiaz threw his fastball for strikes 50.8 percent of the time in 2018, up from 47.5 percent in 2017, according to MLB.com. He located 56.4 percent of his fastballs within the strike zone after doing so 52.7 percent of the time the year before.Consequently, Diaz\u2019s fastball pitch value, as calculated by FanGraphs, skyrocketed from 2.2 runs in 2017 to 13.8 last year.\u201cHis fastball command got him in good counts and in and out of at-bats quickly,\u201d Stottlemyre said \u201cCheck out his average pitches per inning.\u201dThe Post acquiesced and verified Stottlemyre\u2019s claims: In 2017, Diaz threw 1,172 pitches over 66 innings, an average of 17.8 pitches per inning. This past season, he threw 1,171 pitches over his 73 \u00b9/\u2083 frames, an average of 16 pitches per inning. His walks dropped from 32 to the aforementioned 17, and he halved his gopher balls from 10 to 5.The improved fastball led to Diaz using his slider more frequently (37.3 percent, up from 31.3 percent) and more successfully (a 53.8 whiff percentage, up from 46.5 percent).\u201cThat slider has come a long way in terms of the shape and the finish, and definitely its consistency in the zone,\u201d Stottlemyre said. \u201cLast year, he would throw a lot of them in and out of the zone. This year, if he came in with a three-run lead, he would tell me, \u2018I\u2019m not going to show my slider until I need it.\u2019 He would go and try to bury guys with his fastball.\u201cBut with a one-run lead, against the middle of the lineup of [someone like] the Astros, he\u2019d lean on his out pitches.\u201d\u201cThe slider is his put-away pitch,\u201d Espada said. \u201cIt looks very similar to his fastball.\u201dIt\u2019s undeniable Diaz will bring elite stuff, assuming good health, to Queens. What is up for debate is whether he\u2019ll bring a mentality to match. Though his detractors are difficult to locate here at the starting line.\u201cHe handled the WBC really well,\u201d Espada said. \u201cI know that it\u2019s a high level of competition, but it\u2019s nothing like closing a game in New York. It brings a different level of intensity, of focus. But if somebody can do it, this kid can do it. This kid is fearless.\u201d\u201cI think the key is he\u2019s gone out and had bad games and struggled like all players do, and I\u2019ve seen him get back on the horse like it never even happened,\u201d Stottlemyre said. \u201cThey always say you\u2019ve got to have a short memory, and he\u2019s done that.\u201dOr, as articulated by Noel Sevilla, the scout who signed Diaz for the Mariners, \u201cHe has a big set of cojones.\u201dMany have espoused similar sentiments about Van Wagenen as word of these trade discussions became public. If Diaz lives up to his hype, he\u2019ll help his new boss, also a stranger to this fishbowl, do the same.", "title": "Mets would land closer with \u2018big set of cojones\u2019 in Mariners deal", "author": "Ken Davidoff", "date": "December 1, 2018  4:41pm"},

Cindy Hyde-Smith after she made a comment about a \u201cpublic hanging\u201d that was deemed racist and the revelation that she attended a segregated high school.Wait. MLB donates to political campaigns? Regularly, tens of thousands of dollars, too. On whose instructions? The Office of the Commissioner of Baseball\u2019s Political Action Committee. Huh?Why does MLB have/need a political lobby? Rob Manfred\u2019s political operatives donated five grand, the legal maximum, to her campaign in exchange for what? Money for nothing?Was this donation to a candidate from a state that doesn\u2019t have a big league team designed to buy influence or silence? One or both are what five grand donors expect in return.\nOr does MLB\u2019s political lobby buy 50-state protection of its Federal antitrust exemption?Turns out MLB\u2019s explanation on this one doesn\u2019t conform to submitted facts. MLB claimed it made the donation in a one-shot deal, to attend a single fund-raiser \u201cMLB lobbyists were asked to attend.\u201dBut public records show MLB donated $2,500 twice to her campaign, months apart.Regardless, for $5,000 MLB could have gifted Sen. Hyde-Smith two front row seats to a Yankees home game. Always plenty available!On the subject of curious, wait-a-second donations, last week Rutgers observed Giving Tuesday with two mass email solicitations.One was from and for the athletics department, no doubt in great financial need as its Big Ten football team has created a $35 million operations deficit, a hole so deep that taxpayer and student subsidizers can\u2019t see its bottom.The other solicitation was on behalf of non-athletic scholarship RU students, specifically those in a bad way. Kerri Wilson, an RU director of housing:\u201cAt Rutgers University many students experience food insecurity. This can mean skipping meals or eating lower-quality food that doesn\u2019t provide the nutrients they need to fuel their minds.\u201cEach day I see students in need. Students who are uncomfortable asking for help. The Rutgers Student Food Pantry provides more than just a convenient, dependable source of groceries for the week \u2026\u201cRutgers seeks to provide educational opportunities to students regardless of their economic background or income level. On a full stomach, students stand a better chance to excel, create and thrive at Rutgers.\u201cHelp scrap student hunger by making a gift today!\u201dStarving, undernourished Rutgers students? Forgive my indelicate cynicism, Ms. Wilson, but I hope you spread that missive throughout RU\u2019s Athletic Department. After all, since 2012 RU has burned tens of millions to sustain its deadly Big 10 football fever. But that\u2019s RU\u2019s No. 1 priority.Even the low end is costly. In 2016, RU paid its football-only weights training coach $260,000, roughly twice as much as full-time professors.Malnourished students? Truly sorrowful. But with the reminder that charity begins at home, begin with RU\u2019s athletics department.Small wonder big-time college coaches are wary of media. What if they were asked a good question?What would St. Nick Saban say if asked why so many of his recruits are arrested, sometimes more than once. Alabama\u2019s Reuben Foster, last week released by the 49ers after a second domestic-assault charge, was then quickly embraced by the whatever-it-takes \u2019Skins. Foster had previously pleaded guilty to possession of an assault rifle.That\u2019s another thing. Why are so many recruits \u2014 as in countless \u2014 arrested on or near campus carrying deadly weapons?Isaiah Crowell, now a Jets running back, was enrolled at Georgia when arrested for felony possession of firearms \u2014 one with its serial number scraped off \u2014 \u201cin a school zone.\u201dWhy would the most physically imposing men on campus need to carry deadly weapons? What do they anticipate? That kind of trouble? Are they exclusively defensive weapons, used only to return fire? From whom? Is there a beef with the chess club? \u201cI\u2019m off to college, with one in the chamber!\u201dFox\u2019s Thom Brennaman is unafraid to speak impolitic truths during NFL telecasts. During Sunday\u2019s Giants-Eagles, he followed an insert from Browns-Bengals with the rumor that recently fired Browns coach Hue Jackson may replace Bengals coach Marvin Lewis:\u201cCould Hue Jackson possibly be in line to take over for Marvin Lewis? I live in that town [Cincinnati], and I\u2019d venture to say if that happens they might not have 15 people at that stadium \u2026\n\u201cI\u2019m not bashing Jackson, but when you go 15 years with the same head coach and you don\u2019t win a playoff game [Lewis\u2019 Bengals], hiring a guy who has won one game in the last two years would be tough to take.\u201dIn 15 seasons, Lewis\u2019 Bengals were 0-7 in the postseason, including that last-seconds field goal loss to the Steelers three seasons ago, after Vontaze Burfict then Adam \u201cPacman\u201d Jones were penalized a total of 30 yards after one play for out-of-control conduct \u2014 the most inexcusable loss in playoffs history.ESPN\u2019s moral compass may as well be a windsock.For years its Bobby Knight-goes-nuts action reels were regular \u201cSportsCenter\u201d attractions.In 2008, ESPN hired him to analyze games. Presto! Those Knight-goes-nuts reels disappeared from ESPN.Only after Knight was not retained, in April 2015, did those highly disturbing, even historic moving images of Knight\u2019s violent, wild-eyed behavior return on ESPN.And now ESPN\u2019s presenting an independently produced, highly unflattering documentary about Knight \u2014 a program that would not be seen on ESPN had Knight still been employed by ESPN.But such contempt for integrity is nothing new. Just another reminder that you can\u2019t shame the shameless.So Spurs\u2019 coach Gregg Popovich says the 3-point shot is destroying the NBA \u2014 shoving the game further from a reliance on strong, two-way team play, making games mindless, shooting gallery farces. Agreed. But even if he\u2019s the first NBA coach to speak that self-evident truth, what kept him?Now that running to first base is optional and commissioner Rob Manfred encourages kids to pose near home plate, reader Ted McNabb suggests that all ground-rule doubles \u2014 actually, \u201cby-rule\u201d doubles \u2014 \u201cshould be reduced to ground-rule singles.\u201dWhat Nike money can do: Michigan amd Oklahoma football teams wears jerseys carrying a Nike logo depicting a man \u2014 Michael Jordan \u2014 playing basketball.Reader Jim Mitchell: \u201cI watched the CFL\u2019s Grey Cup championship.

He won\u2019t forget Ponds\u2019 effort on the Heat floor anytime soon, either.\u201cHe had a better game than me,\u201d Mullin said.High praise, and it was deserved as the Red Storm (7-0) stayed unbeaten \u2014 extending their best start since 1994-95. Ponds gave St. John\u2019s a needed lift by connecting on a desperation heave from midcourt at the halftime buzzer, then carried the Red Storm in the second half.Over the final 13:37, he nearly outscored Georgia Tech himself \u2014 it was Yellow Jackets 22, Ponds 21 over that closing stretch.\u201cShamorie Ponds is an NBA guy, he hit some NBA-type shots,\u201d Georgia Tech coach Josh Pastner said. \u201cHe\u2019s really, really good.\u201dJustin Simon and LJ Figueroa each scored 13 for the Red Storm.Jose Alvarado scored 17 for Georgia Tech (4-3), while James Banks III and Brandon Alston each scored 14 for the Yellow Jackets. Moses Wright scored 12 for Georgia Tech, which has dropped two straight.In Pastner\u2019s two-plus seasons, the Yellow Jackets had never lost a game where they led by more than 13 \u2014 until now.

Just like the Pirates\u2019 12-point first-half lead Saturday and their nine-point edge in the second stanza.Such is life for a young team finding its way in this minefield of a non-conference schedule coach Kevin Willard formulated.Seton Hall showed its youth and was unable to finish off a quality opponent that was ripe to be put away. As a result, the Pirates couldn\u2019t build off their impressive Wooden Legacy title from last weekend, suffering a bitterly disappointing 70-65 loss to Louisville in front of 8,505 at Prudential Center.\u201cGetting this group to understand time and score, and opportunities, there\u2019s no better way to do it [than] against these teams,\u201d said a clearly frustrated Willard, who was uncharacteristically short with the media in his postgame press conference. \u201cThey made good plays and we didn\u2019t.\u201dThere was the big lead early, a 19-7 edge just 7:17 in, and a 52-43 advantage with 13:52 left in the second half. But on each occasion, a few loose possessions cost the Pirates the chance to pull away, whether the result of bad shots, missed defensive assignments or being a step slow to a loose ball.The biggest problem was the 8:14 stretch of the second half in which Seton Hall (4-3) managed just a single field goal, allowing the Cardinals (5-2) to take control, turning a five-point deficit into a four-point lead.Before Myles Powell\u2019s 3-pointer with 1:59 left, Seton Hall missed 19 of 21 shots, many of them contested drives or forced shots late in the shot clock. They mostly weren\u2019t high-percentage attempts.\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating,\u201d sophomore forward Sandro Mamukelashvili said. \u201cWe\u2019re a young team. Every time it comes down to the wire, I feel like everybody\u2019s a little stressed. So we\u2019ve got to chill out a little bit, trust each other more.\u201dThe Pirates still had opportunities late. With a chance to go ahead with just over a minute left, Myles Cale missed an off-balance runner in the lane on a disjointed possession and Ryan McMahon drained a crushing 3-pointer with 33.6 seconds left to push the lead back to four.Powell scored a game-high 23 points, but was just 2 of 12 from the 3-point line, and Willard said he felt some of the attempts were forced. Mike Nzei added 12 points with six rebounds, but the senior forward didn\u2019t have many opportunities late. That, Willard said, needs to change. Seton Hall was too reliant on the drive.The final minutes were similar to the end of the loss at home to Saint Louis and the win over Miami in the Wooden Legacy final. With Powell hounded by double teams, someone else needed to take charge. It didn\u2019t happen. In previous years, Seton Hall had several late-game options. Right now, there\u2019s only Powell.\u201cI think the biggest thing is other guys have to get a little bit more confident in the fact that they\u2019re going to have to make a play,\u201d Willard said. \u201c[Quincy McKnight] got to the rim twice, Myles Cale got to the rim three times.\u201cIt\u2019s obviously tough, because you want your main guy to have the rock, but those guys have to continue to get confidence that they\u2019re going to get opportunities to make plays.\u201d", "title": "Seton Hall\u2019s offense goes quiet late in ugly loss to Louisville", "author": "Zach Braziller", "date": "December 1, 2018  2:34pm"},

But, regardless of what numbers they produce to the public, here\u2019s a fact: It hasn\u2019t been good enough.If you think it is, take a look at the hit by Dallas defensive back Jaylon Smith on New Orleans running back Alvin Kamara in Thursday\u2019s 13-10 win over the Saints.The hit came on third-and-17 at midfield in the fourth quarter with the Saints trying to rally from a deficit. Kamara caught a pass from Drew Brees and gained eight yards before being punished by the Smith hit. A penalty would have given the Saints a first down at the Dallas 27. Instead, they would never get any closer to tying the game or taking the lead.Smith likely wasn\u2019t trying to hurt Kamara, but it was clearly poor tackling technique, which should be penalized and it wasn\u2019t. That had a major potential impact on the outcome of the game and, more importantly, could have seriously injured Kamara, one of the most dynamic players in the sport.When Brees was asked about the hit, he said, \u201cWhat do you think? Let the league deal with that.\u201d\t\t\t\tTherein lies the problem. They\u2019re not dealing with it well enough.If the league\u2019s officials cannot be counted on to make these calls, then there might have to be a special replay rule set up for helmet-to-helmet hits. Perhaps each coach can be given an extra challenge flag or two to throw when they believe a call has been missed.If you think the NFL is doing enough, then take look at the Cowboy\u2019s 31-23 Thanksgiving win over the Redskins, when Washington tight end Jordan Reed was rammed in the helmet by the helmet of Dallas\u2019 Xavier Woods on a key third down with the Redskins trying to rally from an 11-point deficit.Reed, who suffered two concussions while in college and has had a reported four more known concussions in the NFL, was so livid as he walked to the Washington sideline he angrily threw his helmet. He later tried to plead his case to the referees near the sideline.His words, and the words of too many offensive players in the league, fell on deaf ears.\u201cI asked the referees [and] they said it wasn\u2019t helmet-to-helmet on the field,\u201d Redskins coach Jay Gruden told reporters the day after the game. \u201cBut clearly, when you watch it was. Just a play that they missed for some reason. And when it\u2019s that blatant in front of a lot of people in the middle of the field, you just wonder why that wasn\u2019t called if we\u2019re talking about protection of the players.\u201cIt\u2019s just frustrating because that\u2019s a point of emphasis, so to speak.\u201dSo to speak.", "title": "NFL isn\u2019t backing up its tough talk on this player-safety issue", "author": "Mark Cannizzaro", "date": "December 1, 2018  2:06pm"},

The Nationals have yet to make public whether they will make an 11th-hour bid to retain Bryce Harper or reroute those dollars to bolster their rotation, in particular.The Marlins are the non-contender of the division, yet are intriguing because in J.T. Realmuto they arguably have the most attractive trade piece of this offseason.Ladies and gentleman, the NL East, the most interesting division in the world:Mets \u2014 Brodie Van Wagenen has not tiptoed into the GM responsibility. His first major player transaction would go right into the doozy category. He is on the brink of trading two of the team\u2019s best prospects (Justin Dunn, Jarred Kelenic) while absorbing a good deal of Cano\u2019s pact to land elite closer Edwin Diaz.Van Wagenen is determined to honor his press conference promise to contend in 2019. He seems to think upgrading defense and bullpen are central to do that, so Diaz is not the only reliever the Mets will obtain this offseason. An Andrew Miller (who played for Mickey Callaway in Cleveland) or David Robertson is possible. So is trading Noah Syndergaard if Van Wagenen could mesh finding particularly catching and center field upgrades with landing a free-agent starter who can ably replace Syndergaard.Van Wagenen has demonstrated energy, fearlessness and showmanship early in his tenure. Will that translate into 90-plus wins?Braves \u2014 The defending East champs are gambling that Donaldson and Brian McCann \u2014 both bedevilled by 2018 injuries \u2014 still have high-end production in their games. If so, Atlanta already has gone a long way to addressing priority one this offseason: an offensive boost. They still seek a corner outfielder \u2014 Andrew McCutchen? Michael Brantley? \u2014 to join a lineup with Ronald Acuna, Freddie Freeman and Ozzie Albies, plus Donaldson and McCann.Atlanta has a deep farm system and dollars to spend to pursue end-game bullpen and a top-of-the-rotation starter.Phillies \u2014 But no team has more to spend this offseason than Philadelphia. It was owner John Middleton, who recently said, \u201cWe\u2019re going into this expecting to spend money. And maybe even be a little bit stupid about it.\u2019\u2019The feeling around the sport has been that the Phillies leave the offseason with Harper or Manny Machado \u2014 with a slim chance of both. Plus, they are in on top starters such as Patrick Corbin. Plus they are in on top relievers such as Zach Britton. Plus, they are involved in myriad trade scenarios, including about Seattle shortstop Jean Segura.No team faces more pressure to take big pieces off the board this offseason.Nationals \u2014 I am surprised how many executives and agents I speak to feel Harper still ends up back here (and Machado in Philadelphia). Whether it was done for public relations to suggest effort or for real, the Nationals\u2019 reported $300 million offer to Harper in late September felt like a last effort to keep a homegrown star.And it is not hard to make a case that the Nats are better off with a divorce from Harper and having Adam Eaton, Victor Robles, Juan Soto and Michael Taylor share the outfield rather Washington already has obtained two relievers (Kyle Barraclough and Trevor Rosenthal) and two catchers (Yan Gomes and Kurt Suzuki) to try to distance themselves from 2018, when they were the majors\u2019 most disappointing team.Marlins \u2014 Realmuto is the kind of talent \u2014 especially when available prime-aged star catchers are all but non-existent \u2014 that makes teams change plans. But clubs have said Miami\u2019s requests have been so exorbitant as to all but make Realmuto unmovable. Perhaps, that is only an opening gambit. But the Braves and Nationals \u2014 perhaps the teams that expressed the most interest in the past 12 months \u2014 have locked in two catchers each on major league contracts. An official from one of those teams said, \u201cMiami is not trading him in the division.\u201dIf true, that would take the interested Phillies out, too. The Astros, Brewers and others, though, remain interested.If Realmuto is traded, the Marlins will have depleted themselves of all their star-level players. Which is probably the right approach.

{"url": "https://nypost.com/2018/12/01/mets-mariners-trade-is-latest-lesson-in-naming-a-deals-winner/", "body": "Here\u2019s the thing about predicting trades in real time:It\u2019s like the way the late William Goldman once so perfectly described Hollywood: \u201cNobody knows anything.\u201d We think we know. Fans do. Agents do. Sportswriters do. Talk radio does. We think we can spot a heist a mile away. But we can\u2019t. Not every time.You may recall a column I wrote a few days ago that tore open the anxiety closets of Mets fans everywhere, detailing some of the worst trades in franchise history. But here\u2019s the thing: In the moment, when they happened, most people thought the Mets had done wisely in both 1969 and 1971 when they traded away Amos Otis and Nolan Ryan \u2014 13 All-Star Game appearances between them \u2014 for Joe Foy (from Kansas City) and Jim Fregosi (from the Angels).David Wright helped make this phenomenon go away, but the Mets searched for years \u2014 for decades \u2014 to find a reliable everyday third baseman. It was that obsession that made them pine for Foy and moon over Fregosi. And in the moment it seemed the Mets had done well \u2014 Otis never responded to Gil Hodges (who was certain to be in charge for a decade or more), and Ryan could never keep his blister-infested fingers out of Gus Mauch\u2019s pickle jar.And \u2026 well. That isn\u2019t how either trade is remembered now.Even trades that work out well for the Mets \u2014 Keith Hernandez-for-Neil Allen-and-Rick Ownbey \u2014 aren\u2019t always what they seem. Yes, there was excitement when Frank Cashen pulled off that deal June 15, 1983, but there were also plenty of red flags: Allen was believed to be on the verge of stardom. Hernandez had been an MVP but was known to have his off-field demons and if Whitey Herzog didn\u2019t want him on his team \u2026 well, what did that say?We can shout now, and we can feel like we\u2019re right.But we won\u2019t know. Not after a month. Not after a year. Maybe not until five or six years are past.And even then \u2026This has always been one of my favorites:Many Mets fans jumped at a big omission from my column the other day: when they traded Rusty Staub to the Tigers for an all-but-finished Mickey Lolich. One reader, Lou Ventura, could even cite the date of the trade \u2014 Dec. 12, 1975 \u2014 instantly, as a date that will live in Mets infamy. And yes, that trade was crushing for the Mets. Lolich was 8-13 in his only year as a Met, and his physique made David Wells\u2019 look like Kent Tekulve; Rusty was an All-Star in Detroit and finished fifth in the MVP vote in 1978 when he drove in 121 runs.But I ask you:As popular as Rusty was as a Met (and it was earned; not only was he a key cog in the drive to the \u201973 pennant, but his charity work will forever be remembered and his good will forever revered), the Mets got 3 \u00bd years of Rusty\u2019s prime (he missed 96 games in \u201972 with a broken hand) in exchange for all but 184 games of Ken Singleton\u2019s decidedly borderline Hall of Fame career (his lifetime OPS was .824; Rusty\u2019s was .793, and as a Met it was .778).Couldn\u2019t that be considered a steal, too?Maybe, maybe not. The fact is, it\u2019s a definitely a point of conversation. Which, at their base, is what every trade should be. Like this one.Let\u2019s just say that the NFL\u2019s investigation of Kareem Hunt will probably never be ripped from the headlines for an episode of \u201cLaw & Order\u201d \u2014 unless they want to make the cops look like bumbling buffoons.I threw this out on Twitter the other day, and do so again: This soccer neophyte needs guidance on how it possibly makes sense that the Red Bulls worked all year for home-field (er, home-pitch) advantage \u2026 yet when they took the pitch Thursday they were already hopelessly down 3-0?

Winning mattered to him. I think he set a great example for all of the other players. He\u2019s somebody we\u2019re going to miss very much. He was one of the greatest offensive linemen in Giants history, and he\u2019ll be on that Ring of Honor someday.\u201dThis was Tom Coughlin when Diehl retired in January 2014: \u201cWhen I think of David Diehl, what comes to mind is his indomitable spirit.

And Britton, who will turn 31 on Dec. 22, could be looked upon by the Red Sox as their closer should Craig Kimbrel leave via free agency.After the Red Sox ended the Yankees\u2019 season in four ALDS games, Britton hinted the winning culture in The Bronx was appealing to him and didn\u2019t close the door on a return to the team he joined at the July 31 trade deadline from the Orioles. He appeared in 25 games for the Yankees and posted a 2.88 ERA in 25 innings.Closer Aroldis Chapman can opt out of a contract following the 2019 season and had tendinitis in his left knee that put him on the disabled list from Aug. 22-Sept. 19 this past season. So, the Yankees could bring Britton back as insurance against Chapman leaving two years and $35.4 million to chase more years and dollars. However, until an Achilles tendon injury that required surgery limited him to a total of 41 games this past season, Britton was among the best big league closers and there are several teams who still view the left-hander as an elite closer. From 2014 to 2016, Britton saved 120 games.So what can the Yankees do if Robertson and Britton don\u2019t return? And how does the possibility of Dellin Betances leaving as a free agent following the 2019 season impact this winter\u2019s decision?Could the Yankees sign free agent right-hander Nathan Eovaldi to be rotation insurance and work out of the bullpen until an injury or ineffectiveness forces a move with a starter?Right-hander Adam Ottavino, formerly of the Rockies, is on the Yankees\u2019 radar as is former Yankee Andrew Miller, who pitched for the Indians in the final two months of 2016 and the past two seasons.A second reunion with Robertson is cloudy. In his first stab at free agency, when the right-hander was 29, the Yankees allowed him to flee for the White Sox and a four-year deal worth $46 million. Now, Robertson will turn 34 in April.And there was his role as chairman in a very disturbing postseason shares meeting that was annoying on several levels of the Yankees\u2019 organization. But remember, all teams crave talent while often ignoring the warts and Robertson certainly performed well in 2018 when he went 8-3 with a 3.23 ERA and fanned 91 in 69 \u00b2/\u2083 innings in 69 games.

Hunt then turns around the corner and storms into a man who collides with the woman, sending both to the floor.The woman, identified in February by Cleveland.com as Abigail Ottinger, of Middleburg Heights, Ohio, told police Hunt assaulted her at about 3:45 a.m. at Cleveland\u2019s The Metropolitan at the 9 hotel. Another woman who was with Hunt\u2019s friend said Ottinger had assaulted her, according to police reports obtained by Cleveland.com.According to TMZ, law enforcement obtained the video from The Metropolitan and submitted it to prosecutors, who elected not to charge Hunt. One police report listed Hunt as a suspect, while another listed Ottinger as such. Cleveland police Sgt. Jennifer Ciaccia said the cross complaint indicated that each person claimed they were victimized in the incident.Ottinger, a Kent State student, told cops in February the argument started when she refused to hook up with a member of Hunt\u2019s entourage. One of Hunt\u2019s friends told police they kicked Ottinger and her friend out of the room after learning that they were only 19 years old, but Ottinger said they were booted because she \u201cdidn\u2019t want\u201d one of the men in Hunt\u2019s entourage.Ottinger was further accused of calling Hunt and his friend racial slurs when she was told that she needed to leave. Ottinger and her female friend then waited in a hallway as they tried to get a ride back to Kent State. Hunt\u2019s friend told police he gave the women $20 and that the NFL running back decided to go to bed, according to the police report.Ottinger then stayed in the hallway for roughly 30 minutes as she continued yelling and pounding on the room door, her friend told police. Another woman in Hunt\u2019s group, meanwhile, said she was struck in the face by Ottinger when she went into the hallway to tell the pair to leave, according to the police report.Ottinger told Cleveland.com that \u201cthings got physical\u201d at the hotel, but declined further comment, as did her friend, according to the website.The NFL has yet to take any action against Hunt, who led the league in rushing last season, and it\u2019s unclear if the league pursued the video the gossip site published. The Chiefs, who play at Oakland on Sunday, were originally unaware of the video, according to The Athletic.The footage is eerily reminiscent of the shocking Ray Rice video from 2014, when the former Ravens running back was seen punching his then-fianc\u00e9e in the face in an Atlantic City hotel elevator. The NFL initially suspended Rice for two games, but when the video surfaced \u2014 also on TMZ \u2014 and the outcry was deafening, the Ravens released him and Rice was suspended for the full season. He has not played in the NFL since.Messages seeking comment from NFL and team officials were not immediately returned Friday.", "title": "Chiefs star Kareem Hunt pushes, kicks woman in brutal video", "author": "Joshua Rhett Miller", "date": "November 30, 2018  3:05pm"},
